The average number of students per classroom, y, at Central High School can be estimated using the equation y = 0.8636x + 27.227, where x represents the number of years since 2004 and x ≤ 10. Which of the following statements is the best interpretation of the number 0.8636 in the context of this problem?
Can every map be colored with just four colors so that no two adjacent regions have the same color?
You’re on a game show with three doors. One hides a car, the others goats. After choosing a door, the host reveals a goat behind another door. Do you switch?
What’s the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin?

Find a solution of f(x) = x^3+x−1 = 0 by iteration
Given the data of Example 1.1 plus one more point: ln 9.0 = 2.1972,ln 9.5 = 2.2513,ln 11.0 = 2.3979, compute an approximate value of ln 9.2and obtain an error estimate
Use the Euler method with step size h= 0.1to solve at x= 0.3. y'= sin xy, y(0) = 1
Apply the improved Euler method to solve, choosing again h= 0.2. y'=x+y, y(0) = 0
Apply the fourth order Runge-Kutta method to the IVP y'=x+y, y(0) = 0. Choose h= 0.2as before and compute five steps.
Consider the IVP y'' =−y, y(0) = 0, y'(0) = 1.(32) Using h= 0.1,find an approximate value of y(0.2) to 3 decimal places
A study shows that the average number of pens a university student brings to class is 1.75 and the standard deviation is 0.65. In a sample of 50 university students, find the probability that the mean number of pens brought to class is more than 2.
Suppose the times required for bus 179 to start from Interchange and arrive at EEE form a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 0.5 minute. If a sample of 17 arrival times is selected at random, find the probability that the sample variance is greater than 0.5.
Super big fish balls produced in a factory are supposed to average 4.445 cm in diameter. It is known that σ= 0.127 cm. A random sample of 900 super big fish balls from the production of a single machine gives x= 4.455 cm. Is the machine within acceptable adjustment? Use α= 0.05
The average speed of cars travelling on Malaysian express ways is estimated to be 110 km/h. A random sample of 41 cars travelling on a Singapore express way, PIE, gives an average speed of 100 km/h and a standard deviation of 15 km/h. Can we say, at 2.5% significance level, that cars drive slower on PIE than on Malaysian express ways?
